&nbsp;
***Description:***

This project is based on project Tarmo4 by KrisCubed (link below). This project is "fork" of Tarmo4 project and is created to ease modding and updating this project more frequent and to enable collaborate multiple people at the same time towards to one better Tarmobil. This project uses some parts ***different*** (especially **motor, esc, steering servo**) from Tarmo4 project so please keep this in mind and check part before printing. This project is NOT Print'n'Play project and some skill with 3D printing, electronic, soldering and RC in general is required for successful build. For this project is also good to know how to print with different materials (e.g. ABS/ASA, NYLON, Flex, PETG). Printing with PLA is NOT recommended. In pictures parts in grey and black color are PETG (black is PLASTY MLADEČ PETG and grey is Prusament PETG Urban Grey), orange parts are ASA (Prusament ASA Prusa Orange), blue parts are NYLON (PolyMide™ CoPa Nylon), red parts and tires are Flex (PLASTY MLADEČ TPE88).
